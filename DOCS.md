heavily work in progress

`new LSServer({ options, serverPackages, clientPackages })`
[the 'options' argument IS the 'options' from the WebSocketServer class in the 'ws' module, which LiteSockets builds upon](https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/HEAD/doc/ws.md#new-websocketserveroptions-callback)

just look at the test app instead until this is finished
